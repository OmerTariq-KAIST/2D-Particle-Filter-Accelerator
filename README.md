# 2D-Particle-Filter-Accelerator
This paper proposes a particle filter accelerator that employs a cellular automata-based pseudo-random number generator and an improved systematic resampler based on the Vose Alias method.  The proposed accelerator deployed on the Zedboard (ZC7020) system-on-chip achieves a low execution time of approximately 4.63us.
